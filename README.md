# Breaking Down Authoritarian Elections: Which Components Affect Democratization Prospects
## What is it all about?
An autocratic breakdown does not imply that the regime will successfully make its path to democracy. To make a successful transit to demcracy, a wide range
of institutions is needed to be established. However, political scientists still doubt (and will do so in the near future) which institutions and 
how should they be established in order for democracy to consolidate successfully. In this work I examine some properties of the elections held under
authoritarianism and their impact on the path of democratic consolidation.  

## Method  
I am planning to use a fixed effects OLS linear regression with interaction terms

## Data
V-dem core dataset as well as their Episodes of Regime Transitions set
