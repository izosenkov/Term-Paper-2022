\begin{abstract}
An autocratic breakdown does not imply that the regime will successfully make its path to democracy. To make a successful transit, a wide range of institutions is needed to be established. However, political scientists still doubt which institutions and how should they be established in order for democracy to consolidate successfully. In this work I examine some properties of the elections held under authoritarianism and their impact on the path of democratic consolidation. \end{abstract}

\section*{Introduction}
Current political research agenda has a substantial focus on political regimes and transitions in particular. The newest research in this area is driven by large-N statistical and economical studies. Most of the prominent studies in the area suggest a well-known pool of features of the regime which are associated with democratization. Economic development or the processes which can be associated with it (distribution made by rentier state, for example), international climate, urbanisation and education rates can be seen as factors which propel the process of democratization \parencite{geddes_what_2007}. \par  Another perspective to look from on democratization is to investigate what factors could help the autocratic incumbent to stay in power. It is widely accepted that the success of the regime depends on its ability to institutionalise in a proper way \parencite{gerschewski_three_2013}.  \par From another point of view, some analysts insist that the success of democratic consolidation is also dependent on the way which institutions are set \parencite{schedler_what_1998}. Elections are one of the core institutions of democracy even in its minimalist view \parencite{odonnell_democracy_2001}. Thus it is possible to conclude that elections could play a huge role during the process of democracy consolidation as they are crucial institution of democracy. \par However, most of the research on elections in the context of political regimes and regime transitions is focused "on the two poles". Some scholars extensively study elections in nondemocratic regimes, others investigate their properties in democracies. Surprisingly, the potential link between elections in autocratic regime and its path of democratic consolidation in case of an autocratic breakdown is not studied well. Following a well known tradition of historical institutionalism I argue that institutional context mediates the result one or another force will generate \parencite{hall_political_1996}. \par The main motivation of this paper is that we do not know a lot about the potential impact the properties of the authoritarian elections institute could have on the path of the democratic consolidation. The research question is \textbf{which of the election properties have an impact on the path of the democratization?}. The object of the research are the authoritarian regime's election properties. The subject matter of the research is the impact these properties could have on democratization. The main goal of the paper is to find out which of the elections characteristics have an impact on the path of democratic consolidation after democratic breakdown and to what extent. To achieve it, I run an OLS regression analysis and investigate the results. \par


\section*{Literature review}
This section contains a detailed overview how scholars approached the topic of elections and democratization in this context. \par
Most of the previous studies on the topic of elections in nondemocratic regimes could be divided in three groups: the studies of the role of the elections in authoritarian regime, the studies of actors' behaviour and its implications on the regime, and the studies of authoritarian elections in the context of democratization \parencite{gandhi_elections_2009}. The studies of actors' behaviour and its implications on the regime are not in the scope of this research because this group of studies takes the regime and the electoral institution for granted and on "as it is" basis and makes a focus on the actors' choices on their participation in elections, but it studies neither the institute of the elections nor the democratization process. \par
Why does a dictator need to hold the elections if they are typically seen as a democratic means of political contestation and by their nature could force a legitimate transit of power? Does an incumbent want to be ousted? A large share of the studies of the elections' role in the authoritarian regime considers them not as a threat to the incumbent, but as an instrument for them to prolong their political career. For example, elections can be seen as a means of co-optation. In a broader context of institutionalisation Jennifer Gandhi and Adam Przeworski argue that by creating legislatures and allowing parties to participate in elections an incumbent can create a special arena where it is possible to co-opt opposition and make policy concessions, thus prolonging their time in power. Elections could also legitimate an incumbent. Barbara Geddes shows, that overwhelmingly high poll and election results could make political rivals feel that there is no base for their support. \parencite{geddes_role_2005}. \par % Сюда еще добавить
From the perspective of authoritarian elections' role in democratization most of the studies examine how the elections by themselves and actors which participate in them could affect the regime and/or force the regime transition. For example, Mark Howard and Philip Roessler show that authoritarian elections could lead to "Liberalising election outcome" if opposition forces effectively organise themselves and build coalition or support one candidate jointly \parencite{howard_liberalizing_2006}. Beatriz Magaloni comes to the same conclusion but then adds, that not only opposition consolidation could force the autocrat to stop rigging the election, but also a massive civil protest or disobedience.
